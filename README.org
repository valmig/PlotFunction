* Required software
** wxWidgets libraries
As this program uses the wxWidgets library, ~wx-config~ should be available on your system.
** libvalmath
You can clone the git repository https://github.com/valmig/PlotFunction.git and build the library
following the given instructions.

* Features
** Plotter
plotting functions, algebraic curves and more geometric objects like points, lines, polygons, circles, etc...
** Calculus
analyzes functions (definition gaps, zeros, extreme points, infection points) and computes derivations and
some stammfunctions.
** Rational interpolation
computes the interpolation polynomial to a given set of points.
** Regression
computes the regression polynomial of a given degree to a given set of points.
